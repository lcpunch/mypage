title: About
---

I'm a Web Developer for 5 years, and also worked with C++ game developing for two years.
I was born in Curitiba, Brazil, moved to 7 different cities inside Brazil, and also lived in Guimar√£es, Portugal when I was a child.
I love my wife, the world, the nature, Sci-fi books(Philip K. Dick), comedy, and last, but not least, the web developing.
